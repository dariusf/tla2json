## Support

If you like what I do
—my OSS libraries, my contributions to other OSS libs, [my programming blog](https://japgolly.blogspot.com)—
and you'd like to support me, more content, more lib maintenance, [please become a patron](https://www.patreon.com/japgolly)!
I do all my OSS work unpaid so showing your support will make a big difference.
